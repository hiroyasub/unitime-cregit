Comprehensive University Timetabling System
<http://www.unitime.org>

UniTime is a comprehensive educational scheduling system that supports developing
course and exam timetables, managing changes to these timetables, sharing rooms
with other events, and scheduling students to individual classes.
It is a distributed system that allows multiple university and departmental schedule managers
to coordinate efforts to build and modify a schedule that meets their diverse organizational
needs while allowing for minimization of student course conflicts. It can be used alone to
create and maintain a school's schedule of classes and/or exams, or interfaced with
an existing student information system. 

The system was originally developed as a collaborative effort by faculty,
students, and staff at universities in North America and Europe. The softwar
e is distributed free under an open source license in hopes that other colleges
and universities can benefit their students through better scheduling or wish to
contribute to ongoing research in this area.
