		<title>Course Timetabling Solver</title>
		<item>

		<item>
			<name>Special Registration</name>
			<description>
				<line>The following work has been done to support special registration at Purdue.</line>
				<line>Enable special registration in Scheduling Assistant by adding &amp;mode=specreg parameter in the URL.
					<line>In this mode, a student is allowed to pick a section that is not available, conflicting with some other section that the student has, or reserved for some other students.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Added ability to select the current academic session using URL parameters term and campus
					(these may include external term and campus names, if unitime.custom.ExternalTermProvider is configured).</line>

		<title>Constraint Solver (1.3.114)</title>
		<item>
			<name>Course Timetabling: Max Half-Days Constraint</name>
			<description>
				<line>The MaxHalfDays constraint limits the number of half-days of week during which the given set of classes are taught.</line>
				<line>It has one parameter: a maximal number of week half-days during which the given set of classes can be placed.</line>
				<line>A day is split by noon (which can be changed using General.HalfDaySlot parameter).</line>
				<line>A class starting before noon is considered a morning class (despite of its end), a class starting at noon or later is considered an afternoon class.</line>
				<line>For instance, a reference MaxHalfDays:4 translates to a maximum number of 4 half-days a week.</line>
			</description>

		<item>
			<name>Course Timetabling: added MaxHoles distribution constraint</name>
			<description>
				<line>The MaxHoles constraint limits the number of free time (holes) for an instructor on a day (between the first and the last class on a day).</line>
				<line>It has one parameter: a maximal amount of free time that an instructor can have on a day in minutes.</line>
				<line>For example, reference _MaxHoles:120_ translates to a maximum number of two hours of total free time between the first and the last class on a day:
					<line>if required, having more free time is prohibited</line>
					<line>if preferred or strongly preferred, the excessive free time is penalized</line>
				</line>

		<item>
			<name>Course Timetabling: Student Conflicts</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added a naive, yet effective approach for minimizing holes in student schedule.
					<line>The new StudentMinimizeScheduleHoles criterion penalizes all cases where a student has two classes taught on the same day that are not back-to-back.</line>
					<line>The penalization is based on the time distance between the two classes, computed in hours.</line>
					<line>These penalties are weighted by Comparator.MinimizeStudentScheduleHolesWeight, which defaults to 1/20 of the Comparator.StudentConflictWeight.</line>
					<line>To enable this criterion, add org.cpsolver.coursett.criteria.additional.StudentMinimizeScheduleHoles to General.AdditionalCriteria.</line>
				</line>
				<line>Added a naive, yet effective approach for minimizing number of days in student schedule.
					<line>The new StudentMinimizeDaysOfWeek criterion penalizes all cases where a student has two classes taught on different days.</line>
					<line>These penalties are weighted by Comparator.MinimizeStudentScheduleDaysWeight, which defaults to 1/20 of the Comparator.StudentConflictWeight.</line>
					<line>To enable this criterion, add org.cpsolver.coursett.criteria.additional.StudentMinimizeDaysOfWeek to General.AdditionalCriteria.</line>
				</line>
				<line>As the StudentMinimizeScheduleHoles criterion tends to spread the student among as many days as possible, the second criterion StudentMinimizeDaysOfWeek can be used to counteract this effect, if desired.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Examination Timetabling: Period Preferences</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added additional information about how well are the period preferences satisfied into the solution extended info
					(showing how many time a preferred, a strongly preferred, etc. period is selected for an exam).</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Examination Timetabling: Room Split Penalty</name>
			<description>
				<line>Increased the limit on the maximal number of rooms that an exam can take to 30.</line>
			</description>

		<item>
			<name>Examination Timetabling: Save XML</name>
			<description>
				<line>Corrected examination period penalty value.</line>
			</description>
		</item>
		<item>
			<name>Student Scheduling: Scheduling Assistant Weights</name>
			<description>
