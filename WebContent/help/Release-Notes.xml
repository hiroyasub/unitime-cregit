			<name>Advisor Course Recommendations</name>
			<description>
				<line>A page for the advisor to fill with a student while advising him/her on what courses to take the next term.</line>
				<line>It looks a lot like the Student Course Requests page, with a few fields added (credits per course, notes, etc.).</line>
				<line>When opened, the advisor can look up a student and the page gets pre-populated with the existing data.</line>
				<line>The page  automatically offers course suggestions (but it is possible to put in a free text too), fills in credits, count the credit totals, etc.</line>
				<line>When submitted, there is a PDF version generated that can be printed and signed by the student.</line>
				<line>Allows for student status change when submitted; no need for the advisor to use the dashboard to change the student status.</line>
				<line>UniTime keeps record of these advisor course requests for possible auditing/reporting (what students requested versus what they have been advised, list students that have been already advised that did not fill their course requests in, etc.).</line>
				<line>Student Course Requests page can be pre-populated with these courses, or a student can review the courses filled in by the advisor.</line>
				<line>Optionally, course recommendation may contain wait-listing toggles (based on unitime.acr.waitlist parameter).</line>

				<line>The restriction can be on courses (using regular expression for course name), or on course configurations (using regular expression on instructional method reference).</line>
				<line>Added ability to hide courses that do not have an online-only option from the online-only students and vice versa (students can not look them up on the Course Requests or Scheduling Assistant page).</line>

					<line>There is a new parameter of student schedule status (students may or may not be allowed to mark courses as No-Subs).</line>
				</line>
				<line>It is also possible to only allow advisor recommendations to mark courses as No-Subs (students are not allow to see/set No-Subs or Wait-List toggles).
					<line>In this case, solver parameter Load.UseAdvisorWaitLists must be set to true to check for these during the data load.</line>
