			<name>Minimal Perturbation Mode</name>
			<description>
				<line>In priority and equal weigthing, the difference of an enrollment (from the initial one) is computed as an average using the following schema:
					<line>an initial section counts as 1</line>
					<line>same choice section counts as 0.9 (parameter StudentWeights.SameChoice)</line>
					<line>same time section counts as 0.7 (parameter StudentWeights.SameTime)</line>
					<line>different time section counts as 0</line>
				</line>
				<line>Non-initial enrollment weight is penalized with weight StudentWeights.Perturbation (defaults to 0.100).</line>
				<line>When MPP is enabled, solution info contains the following three new properties:
					<line>Perturbations: same section assigned (% of initial section assigned over all course requests with initial enrollment)</line>
					<line>Perturbations: same choice assigned (% of same time and instructor section assigned over all course requests with initial enrollment)</line>
					<line>Perturbations: same time assigned (% of same time section assigned over all course requests with initial enrollment)</line>
				</line>
				<line>When Sectioning.KeepInitialAssignments is set to true (defaults to false), only the initial value is in the variableâ€™s domain (when there is an initial value).
					<line>Also there is a new global constraint (named FixInitialAssignments) that prevents unassignment of an initial value by another global constraint (limits, reservations).</line>
				</line>

			<name>Request Groups</name>
			<description>
				<line>Added ability to keep students of the same group together.</line>
				<line>Measured as an average probability of two students (of a group) that are requesting the same course being given the same section (of the same subpart).</line>
				<line>There is a new weight (named StudentWeights.SameGroup, defaults to 0.1) expressing how much this criterion affects the student weight (in both priority and equal weighting).
					<line>This means that if a student is being enrolled into a completely different section, weight of such an enrollment is decreased by 10%
						(the metric reflects how much are the students spread between the sections of the course).</line>
				</line>
				<line>There is a new Request Groups report on the Student Scheduling Solver Reports page.</line>
				<line>Request groups are loaded in only when the solver paramter Load.RequestGroups is set to true, default is false</line>
